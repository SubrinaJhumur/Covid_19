### COVID-19 SMALL DATASET
I have taken a small dataset of COVID-19, just for my understanding purpose. Here I work on the original dataset which contains about 19000 rows.

The dataset is used here until 29 April 2020 and has records as of 29 April 2020.

This data is available as a CSV file, downloaded from Kaggle.

I will analyze this data using the pandas data frame.
